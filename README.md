# Happy Hours - Audriana Evans

##Project description 
### Happy hours is a website where you can not only find flavorful cocktails of your choosing but where you can share your own recipes with everyone else as well. This website is super helpful for when you have a girls night out, an in-home brunch, or even if you just want to show off your new cocktail making skills. To get you familiar with the website, let me go through each of the links and waht to expect. The home page is filled with pictures of different cocktails that others have shared. The 'cocktails' link is where you will find the various drink recipes and if you click on the 'CreateYourOwn' link, that is where you can share your favorite recipes.
